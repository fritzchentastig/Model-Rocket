# Model-Rocket
This is a Project by fritchentastig and xByNilzz

It consists of the code used on the arduino, plans for the electrical circuits, the math and models we use to calculate all of this.

All of this is for our project, do not use this stuff if you don't know what all of this means and know how to adapt this to your project.
